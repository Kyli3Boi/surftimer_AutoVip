# surftimer_AutoVip
Manage VIP for Top players automatically


<h1> About </h1>
<li> This plugin is intended for server owners who wish to grant their top players with VIP and would like it to be managed automatically.
<li> Could this have been done within surftimer itself. Yes it could have and would have been a lot easier but i decided not to. Why because i felt like challanging myself.

<h1> Installation </h1>
<li> Download files
<li> Shutdown server
<li> Move .smx file to <code>addons/sourcemod/plugins</code>
<li> Before starting server please create a backup of your current VIPs so if something goes wrong you dont loose your data

<h1> Usage </h1>
<li> Plugin will create <code>surftimer_AutoVip.cfg</code> in <code>cfg/sourcemod</code> once loaded, which will contain the various customizable options
<li> Plugin will create a new table in your <code>surftimer</code> database which is used for comparisons. There is no need to do anything with this table.

<h1> Issues </h1>
<li> If you find issues please open a "issue" on Github and ill try my best to resolve the issue
